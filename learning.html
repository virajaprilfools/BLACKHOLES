What is a black hole?<br>
What is a black hole you may ask ? A black hole is the aftermath of a giant star shrinking and shrinking until it shrinks and shrinks until it becomes something entirely else. A white dwarf. If it were to shrink even more, it would become a neutron star, and even more. A black hole. now with all that shrinking something has to be at the centre of it. the singularity we will discuss that and other parts of the black hole in the next paragraph. a black hole is one of the most interesting and mysterious objects in the universe confusing scientists for over 100 yrs. The functionings of the black hole is partially solved but we have just scraped the surface of the mysteries of a black hole.

how does a black hole work?<br>
a black hole has some important areas that are important to note. The first one is the singularity.
the singularity is the centre of the black hole. in thst part of the black hole, the mass is said to be infinitely dense while it is infinitely small. This can not be true but people are still finding something to replace the singularity. another major part of a black hole is the event horizon. This part of the black hole is important because it is the point of no return. When you cross the event horizon, not even light can escape it. Think of the black hole like a waterfall the waterfall pulls you but you can still take a log and jump away but when you cross a point it is too late and you can not escape. This relates to a black hole's function but that does not mean it is a cosmic vaccum that pulls things in. If a black hole the MASS not the size of the sun were to replace it. all the planets would orbit as usual. The accretio disk is where all the matter taken by the black hole recently is getting taken in by the black hole in a fiery disk. matter in a black hole sometimes comes out of it in a process known as hawking radiation. with hawking radiation, matter goes out of the black hole. it takes ages for it to start, but over time it gets faster until black holes dissapear completely.

the most famous black holes and classes of black holes !<br>
Black holes come in many shapes and sizes. the sizes of black holes is determined by the class of the hole. there are many types of black holes such as primordial black holes, about the size of a mountain. They would be made at the start of the universe. since they are so small scientists do not know if they exist or not.
